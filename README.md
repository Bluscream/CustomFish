# CustomFish
MORE FISH FOR SUBNAUTICA

### What it does?
Provides a framework for easily adding custom fish to subnautica. All you need to provide are assets (and in the future, attributes) and
watch your fish come to life!

I've included an example project to show how it works, but no assets have been uploaded to GitHub

DISCLAIMER: Currently fish dont actually do anything, they just fall to the ground, but they have essential components on them
